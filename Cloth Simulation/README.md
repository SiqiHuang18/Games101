# Assignment 4: Cloth Simulation

<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>

<p>
Here I implemented a simulation and rendering of a cloth sheet. The cloth is built from a set of point masses and springs that account for 
structural, shearing and bending constraints. Its motion is simulated via Verlet integration.
