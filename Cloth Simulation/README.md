# Cloth Simulation

<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>

<p>
Here I implemented a simulation and rendering of a cloth sheet. The cloth is built from a set of point masses and springs that account for 
structural, shearing and bending constraints and its motion is simulated via Verlet integration. It also handles the collision detection with 
sphere, plane and uses spatial hashing for self-collision detection. Finally I added Phong shader,texture shader and mirror shader to the cloth
with shader programs in Opengl.

<h2 align="middle">Part V: Shader </h2>

Shaders are programs on GPU that parallelize some parts of graphics pipeline. Vertex shader handles the transformation of each vertex in parallelï¼Œ
and it passes the geometric information of vertices to the fragment shader. Fragment shader then combines the geometric information and light information
in a way that can simulate different materials' interatction with light, and output the resulting color onto the screen.
